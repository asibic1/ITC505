        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Young children are filled with wonder. As children in Bosnia, we all 
            had our hopes and dreams. We believed in magic with childlike 
            innocence and created grand plans for the future. Like kids everywhere, 
            my Bosnian friends and I aspired to be teachers, athletes, artists, 
            astronauts, entrepreneurs, engineers, doctors and scientists. None 
            of us ever dreamed of becoming genocide and abuse survivors, Muslim 
            refugees in America and single parents raising two kids on their own, 
            with no family to lean on, while coping with the grief of suicide loss.</p>
        <p>Yet here I am. That has been my life in a nutshell. But my life has 
            also been so much more. Along with tragedy and trauma, I’ve 
            experienced love and laughter, great friendship, and career success. 
            I have two beautiful children whom I love more than life itself. 
            I’ve travelled to many beautiful parts of the world, eaten and 
            prepared delicious foods, listened to great music, and danced with 
            friends. In short, I’ve lived life in all its sadness and glory, and 
            I’d like to think I’ve learned a few things along the way.</p>
        <p>Until my early teens, I didn’t even fully comprehend what it meant to 
            be a Muslim. When I was a child, it simply meant the boys in our 
            family were circumcised and we didn’t eat pork. It was not us versus 
            them, Muslims versus Christians. We were all kids, absolutely equal 
            before God. Kids with dreams about the future, with hopes of our 
            crushes asking us to a school dance. Happy kids who played 
            hide-and-go-seek together in the neighborhood. Smiling kids who 
            kicked a soccer ball around a field, cooled off by the river in the 
            dog days of summer, spending summer breaks vacationing with our 
            parents on the Mediterranean coast.</p>
        <p>Then it all changed in the cataclysm of war. Seemingly overnight our 
            peaceful country was ripped apart by an aggressor. There was 
            violence and killing, mass executions and torture, rape and genocide. 
            As a Muslim family, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time, 
            but we were luckier than some—we made it out alive as refugees and 
            eventually settled in the United States.</p>
        <p>I’m not going to lie. We faced hard times in our new lives in our 
            adopted country, exiled from everything we had always known. Many of 
            my childhood dreams were shattered, and some turned into outright 
            nightmares. Other dreams have come true, however, and exceeded my 
            expectations in ways I never could have imagined. For the fulfillment 
            of these dreams, I am eternally grateful.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>It was on the eve of my fortieth birthday, beholden to no one but God 
            and those I cherish most, that I solemnly reflected on these thoughts 
            and the fact that I was simply happy to be alive, to have survived. 
            I sat outside on a hot August evening, amidst palm trees and saguaro 
            cactus of the Sonoran Desert, waiting for the clock to strike 
            midnight and mark my forty years of life on this planet. A life both 
            ordinary and extraordinary, a life that has straddled two worlds, a 
            life filled with tragedy and triumph. And though I’ve been filled 
            with grave doubt and teetered on the edge of the abyss of despair, 
            I’ve always come back to this: the human spirit, fueled by love, 
            cannot be held in check. We are all capable of great feats of courage 
            and love. And if I can do it, so can you.</p>
        <p>That’s why I’m telling my story.</p>
